        Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe.
        Sure, we&apos;re too old to change the world, but what about that kid,
        sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local
        library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the
        Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn&apos;t HE deserve better? Look. If
        you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you&apos;d better
        think again. This is about that kid&apos;s right to read a book without
        getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe
        that&apos;s how y&apos;get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.
